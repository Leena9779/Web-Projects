        <h2 id="life">Life and Career</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>The first Linux prototypes were publicly released in <b>late 1991</b>. <b>Version 1.0</b> was released on <b>14 March 1994</b>.

            Torvalds first encountered the <b>GNU Project</b> in fall of 1991 when another Swedish-speaking computer science student, Lars Wirzenius, took him to the University of Technology to listen to free software guru Richard Stallman's speech. Torvalds would ultimately switch his original license (which forbade commercial use) to Stallman's GNU General Public License version 2 (GPLv2) for his Linux kernel after complaints of distributors being unable to recoup their costs due to a non-commercial clause.
            
            After a visit to Transmeta in late 1996, Torvalds accepted a position at the company in California, where he <b>worked from February 1997 to June 2003</b>. He then moved to the Open Source Development Labs, which has since merged with the Free Standards Group to become the Linux Foundation, under whose auspices he continues to work. In June 2004, Torvalds and his family moved to Dunthorpe, Oregon to be closer to the OSDL's headquarters in Beaverton.
            
            From 1997 to 1999, he was involved in 86open, helping select the standard binary format for Linux and Unix. In 1999, he was named by the MIT Technology Review TR100 as one of the world's top 100 innovators under age 35.
            
            In 1999, Red Hat and VA Linux, both leading developers of Linux-based software, presented Torvalds with stock options in gratitude for his creation.[29] That year both companies went public and Torvalds's share value briefly shot up to about US$20 million.[30][31]
            
            His personal mascot is a penguin nicknamed Tux, which has been widely adopted by the Linux community as the Linux kernel's mascot.
            
            Although Torvalds believes <b>"open source is the only right way to do software"</b>, he also has said that he uses the "best tool for the job", even if that includes proprietary software. He was criticized for his use and alleged advocacy of the proprietary BitKeeper software for version control in the Linux kernel. He subsequently wrote a <b>free-software replacement for it called Git</b>.
            
            In 2008, Torvalds stated that he used the Fedora Linux distribution because it had fairly good support for the PowerPC processor architecture, which he favored at the time. He confirmed this in a 2012 interview. Torvalds abandoned GNOME for a while after the release of GNOME 3.0, saying, "The developers have apparently decided that it's 'too complicated' to actually do real work on your desktop, and have decided to make it really annoying to do". He then switched to Xfce. In 2013, Torvalds resumed using GNOME, noting that "they have extensions now that are still much too hard to find; but with extensions you can make your desktop look almost as good as it used to look two years ago".
            
            The Linux Foundation currently sponsors Torvalds so he can work full-time on improving Linux.
            
            Torvalds is known for vocally disagreeing with other developers on the Linux kernel mailing list.Calling himself a "really unpleasant person", he explained, "I'd like to be a nice person and curse less and encourage people to grow rather than telling them they are idiots. I'm sorry—I tried, it's just not in me." His attitude, which he considers necessary for making his points clear, has drawn criticism from Intel programmer Sage Sharp and systemd developer Lennart Poettering, among others.
            
            On Sunday, 16 September 2018, the Linux kernel Code of Conflict was suddenly replaced by a new Code of Conduct based on the Contributor Covenant. Shortly thereafter, in the release notes for Linux 4.19-rc4, Torvalds apologized for his behavior, calling his personal attacks of the past "unprofessional and uncalled for" and announced a period of "time off" to "get some assistance on how to understand people's emotions and respond appropriately". It soon transpired that these events followed The New Yorker approaching Torvalds with a series of questions critical of his conduct. Following the release of <b>Linux 4.19 on 22 October 2018</b>, Torvalds returned to maintaining the kernel.</p>
            
        <h4>The Linus/Linux connection</h4>
        <p>Initially, Torvalds wanted to call the kernel he developed Freax (a combination of "free", "freak", and the letter X to indicate that it was a Unix-like system), but his friend Ari Lemmke, who administered the FTP server where the kernel was first hosted, named Torvalds' directory linux.</p>

            <p>As of 2006, approximately 2% of the Linux kernel was written by Torvalds himself.Despite the thousands who have contributed to it, his percentage is still one of the largest. However, he said in 2012 that his own personal contribution is now mostly merging code written by others, with little programming.He retains the highest authority to decide which new code is incorporated into the standard Linux kernel.

            <br><br>Torvalds holds the Linux trademark and monitors its use,chiefly through the <b>Linux Mark Institute</b>.</p>

        <h2 id="personal">Personal Life</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Torvalds is married to Tove Torvalds (née Monni), a six-time Finnish national karate champion, whom he met in late 1993. He was running introductory computer laboratory exercises for students and instructed the course attendees to send him an e-mail as a test, to which Tove responded with an e-mail asking for a date.They were later married and have three daughters, two of whom were born in the United States. The Linux kernel's reboot system call accepts their dates of birth (written in hexadecimal) as magic values.

            Torvalds has described himself as "completely a-religious—atheist", adding, "I find that people seem to think religion brings morals and appreciation of nature. I actually think it detracts from both. It gives people the excuse to say, 'Oh, nature was just created,' and so the act of creation is seen to be something miraculous. I appreciate the fact that, 'Wow, it's incredible that something like this could have happened in the first place.'" He later added that while in Europe religion is mostly a personal issue, in the United States it has become very politicized. When discussing the issue of church and state separation, he said, "Yeah, it's kind of ironic that in many European countries, there is actually a kind of legal binding between the state and the state religion." In "Linus the Liberator", a story about the March LinuxWorld Conference, Torvalds says: "There are like two golden rules in life. One is 'Do unto others as you would want them to do unto you.' For some reason, people associate this with Christianity. I'm not a Christian. I'm agnostic. The other rule is 'Be proud of what you do.'"
            <br>
            <br>
            In 2004, Torvalds moved with his family from Silicon Valley to Portland, Oregon.
            
            In 2010, Torvalds became a United States citizen and registered to vote in the United States. As of that year, he was unaffiliated with any U.S. political party, saying, "I have way too much personal pride to want to be associated with any of them, quite frankly."
            
            Linus developed an interest in scuba diving in the early 2000s and has achieved numerous certifications, leading him to create the Subsurface project.</p>

        <h3>Git</h3>

<p>On <b>3 April 2005</b>, Torvalds began development on Git, version control software that later became widely used. On 26 July 2005, he turned over Git's maintenance to Junio Hamano, a major project contributor.</p>

<h3>Subsurface</h3>
<p>Subsurface is software for logging and planning scuba dives, which Torvalds began developing in late 2011. It is <b>free and open-source software</b> distributed under the terms of the <b>GNU</b> General Public License version 2. <b>Dirk Hohndel</b> became its head maintainer in late 2012.

<li>In 2004, he was named one of the <b>most influential people</b> in the world by Time magazine.</li>
<li>In 2006, the magazine's Europe edition named him one of the <b>revolutionary heroes of the past 60 years</b>.</li>

<br>
In 2010, as part of a series called The Britannica Guide to the World's Most Influential People, Torvalds was listed among The 100 <b>Most Influential Inventors of All Time</b> (ISBN 9781615300037).
